#README.md

This is the readme for the Blackboard Downloader. This program will prompt for a username and password for blackboard and will download all documents off Blackboard. Right now, it will download .pdf, .ppt, and .doc files. It structures the downloads in the same fashion that blackboard does, so the file for your syllabus will be under the 'Syllabus' folder, the assignments from the year will be under the 'Assignments' folder, etc.
