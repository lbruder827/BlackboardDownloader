#README.md

This is the README for the Blackboard Downloader. This program will prompt for a username and password for blackboard and will download all documents off Blackboard. It structures the downloads in the same fashion that blackboard does, so the file for your syllabus will be under the 'Syllabus' folder, the assignments from the year will be under the 'Assignments' folder, etc. It will only go to a depth of one sub-folder. For instance, if you have Course Content -> HW -> HW Solutions, it will download everything in the HW folder, but won't download anything in the HW Solutions folder. Most course layout seems to be Course Content -> HW Solutions -> ..files.., so this is what it was written for.
